History & changes
=================


v0.5 (20160818)
---------------

- a major and breaking change: for clarity, individual fields are now called 'rows' instead of 'items' and their iterator is 'r_iter' instead of 'i_iter'

- extra columns are now explicitly allowed but can be disallowed

- now checks for required columns in the input

- this will now work with missing, non-required columns (e.g. matrix)

- we now check for the correct types in the type, validation, identifier and required columns.
