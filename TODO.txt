To do
=====

* better parsing of tags and repeats
* rename "item" to "row" for clarity but allow backwards compatibility
* fake subsections that can appear inside sections but not in the form
* tags are equal to values, and can be included?
* better template error reporting (esp. unknown identifiers)
* Embed post-validation in the final output / expansion stage
